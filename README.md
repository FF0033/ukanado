## u kana do

** work in progress **
A flashcard style kana learning game to be. Type the character you see at the top of the stack to progress. Each 'mission' will have 100 characters to complete, which will measure the time taken to complete.

A demo is available at:

Your browser must support ES6 to use this version, a compiled (ES2015) version may be released to a website when this thing becomes more stable. If Github pages ever supports ES6 transpilation I will set it up :-)

Roadmap coming soon
